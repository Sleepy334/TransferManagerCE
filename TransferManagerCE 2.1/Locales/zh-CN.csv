"optionPreferLocalService","首选本地服务"
"optionPreferLocalService_txt","通过仅将低优先级请求与同一区域内（或任何区域外）的服务建筑进行匹配，进一步提高服务的局部性。 一旦未完成的请求成为高优先级，它将由附近的任何服务提供服务。 影响：垃圾、警察、医疗保健、维修、邮件、出租车。"
"GROUP_WAREHOUSE_OPTIONS","Warehouse Options"
"optionWarehouseFirst","Match Warehouse Offers First"
"optionWarehouseFirst_txt","This option will match incoming warehouse offers early in the matching process which will result in most goods transfers occurring through warehouses."
"optionWarehouseReserveTrucks","预留仓库货运卡车供本地运输使用"
"optionWarehouseReserveTrucks_txt","启用“仓库优先”功能时，建议预留一定比例的仓库货车以满足城市需求，以免所有卡车用于出口"
"txtNewWarehouseReserveTrucks","This option will lower the OUT offer priority when the remaining truck count is less than this percentage. Which has the effect of reserving truck capacity for satisfying high priority local demand."
"optionNewWarehouseTransfer","改进的仓库间转移"
"txtNewInterWarehouseMatching","此选项允许以较低优先级进行仓库间转移，但会检查存储级别以确保仓库不会漫无目的地来回发送货物而没有任何好处。"

This option changes the offer to be the number of available vehicles, which can result in improved matching.\r\nIt now also increases offer priority when less than 1/2 of vehicles are in use."
