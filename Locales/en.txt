GROUP_SERVICE_OPTIONS	Service Options
optionPreferLocalService	Prefer local district services

Once an unfulfilled requests becomes high priority, it will be served by any nearby service offer though. Affects: garbage, police, health care, maintenance, mail, taxi.

GROUP_WAREHOUSE_OPTIONS	Goods Delivery Options
optionWarehouseFirst	Warehouse First

optionWarehouseReserveTrucks	Reserve warehouse cargo trucks for local transfers
optionWarehouseReserveTrucks_txt	Recommended to enable with Warehouse First: reserve 25% of warehouse truck capacity for satisfying city demand, prevents all trucks being used for export.
optionWarehouseNewBalanced	Warehouse improved locality
optionWarehouseNewBalanced_txt	Warehouses will wait to buy from local warehouses or sell to local warehouse before deciding to import/export respectively. This should reduce unnecessary import/export and make intra-city warehouse transfers more reliable. Note that imports/exports will still happen.

optionPreferExportShipPlaneTrain_txt	All import/exports attempt to prioritize usage of available ship, train or plane connections instead of roads, even if a road connection is closer.
