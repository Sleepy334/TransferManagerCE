"optionPreferLocalService_txt","Περαιτέρω βελτίωση της τοποθεσίας των υπηρεσιών με την αντιστοίχιση αιτημάτων χαμηλής προτεραιότητας μόνο με κτίρια υπηρεσιών εντός της ίδιας περιφέρειας (ή εκτός οποιασδήποτε περιοχής). Μόλις ένα ανεκπλήρωτο αίτημα γίνει υψηλή προτεραιότητα, θα εξυπηρετείται από οποιαδήποτε προσφορά της κοντινής υπηρεσίας, όμως. Επηρεάζει: σκουπίδια, αστυνομία, υγειονομική περίθαλψη, συντήρηση, ταχυδρομείο, ταξί."
"txtPreferLocalService","Περιορίστε τις υπηρεσίες στις τοπικές περιοχές ταιριάζοντας τις αιτήσεις χαμηλής προτεραιότητας μόνο με τα κτίρια υπηρεσιών στην ίδια περιοχή. Μόλις ένα ανεκπλήρωτο αίτημα γίνει υψηλή προτεραιότητα, θα επιτρέπεται να εξυπηρετείται από οποιαδήποτε προσφορά υπηρεσιών σε κοντινή απόσταση."
"txtPreferLocalServiceWarning","Προειδοποίηση: Αυτή είναι μια ισχυρή επιλογή, παρακαλώ βεβαιωθείτε ότι έχετε καθορισμένες περιοχές για κάθε μια από τις περιοχές σας και να έχουν διαθέσιμες υπηρεσίες σε αυτές τις περιοχές πριν ενεργοποιήσετε αυτή την επιλογή."
"GROUP_WAREHOUSE_OPTIONS","Επιλογές Αποθήκης"
"optionWarehouseFirst","Match Warehouse Offers First"
"optionWarehouseFirst_txt","This option will match incoming warehouse offers early in the matching process which will result in most goods transfers occurring through warehouses."
"optionWarehouseReserveTrucks","Reserve warehouse cargo trucks for local transfers"
"optionWarehouseReserveTrucks_txt","Recommended to enable with Warehouse First: reserve a percentage of warehouse truck capacity for satisfying city demand, prevents all trucks being used for export."
"txtNewWarehouseReserveTrucks","Αυτή η επιλογή θα μειώσει την προτεραιότητα προσφοράς όταν ο αριθμός των υπόλοιπων φορτηγών είναι μικρότερος από αυτό το ποσοστό. Το οποίο έχει ως αποτέλεσμα την κράτηση χωρητικότητας φορτηγών για την ικανοποίηση τοπικής ζήτησης υψηλής προτεραιότητας."
"optionNewWarehouseTransfer","Βελτιωμένη Μεταφορά Εσωτερικής Αποθήκης"
"txtNewInterWarehouseMatching","This option allows inter-warehouse transfers to occur at lower priorities but checks the storage levels to ensure warehouses don't aimlessly send goods back and forth for no benefit."
