"GROUP_SERVICE_DISTRICT_OPTIONS","District Options"
"optionPreferLocalService","Prefer local district services"
"optionPreferLocalService_txt","Further improve locality of services by matching low priority requests only with service buildings within the same district (or outside any district). Once an unfulfilled requests becomes high priority, it will be served by any nearby service offer though. Affects: garbage, police, health care, maintenance, mail, taxi."
"txtPreferLocalService","Restrict services to local districts by matching low priority requests only with service buildings within the same district. Once an unfulfilled request becomes high priority, it will be allowed to be served by any nearby service offer."
"txtPreferLocalServiceWarning","Warning: This is a powerful option, please ensure you have defined districts for each of your areas and have services available within these districts before enabling this option."
"GROUP_WAREHOUSE_OPTIONS","Warehouse Options"
"optionWarehouseFirst","Match Warehouse Offers First"
"optionWarehouseFirst_txt","This option will match incoming warehouse offers early in the matching process which will result in most goods transfers occurring through warehouses."
"optionWarehouseReserveTrucks","Reserve warehouse cargo trucks for local transfers"
"optionWarehouseReserveTrucks_txt","Recommended to enable with Warehouse First: reserve a percentage of warehouse truck capacity for satisfying city demand, prevents all trucks being used for export."
"txtNewWarehouseReserveTrucks","This option will lower the OUT offer priority when the remaining truck count is less than this percentage. Which has the effect of reserving truck capacity for satisfying high priority local demand."
"optionNewWarehouseTransfer","Improved Inter-Warehouse Transfer"
"txtNewInterWarehouseMatching","This option allows inter-warehouse transfers to occur at lower priorities but checks the storage levels to ensure warehouses don't aimlessly send goods back and forth for no benefit."
"GROUP_FACTORY_OPTIONS","Factory Options"
"optionFactoryFirst","Match Factory Offers First"
"optionFactoryFirstText","This option will match incoming factory offers early in the matching process to ensure factories are matched with the closest available offer for improved operation."

This option changes the offer to be the number of available vehicles, which can result in improved matching.\r\nIt now also increases offer priority when less than 1/2 of vehicles are in use."
